# Bike Sharing in Des Moines

### Overview
This project aims to determine whether or not a bike sharingn program is viable for the city of Des Moines, Iowa.  This intial analysis examines data from New Yor City's Citi Bike program for August of 2019.  The following set of visualizations display the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each day of the week, the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, the total number of trips for each user type, and total number of bike trips for each user type and gender for each birth year.

### Analysis
##### Checkout Times for Users

The peak trip duration for all users is 5 minutes. The vast majority of rides are under 50 minutes, and are heavily clustered between 1 and 23 minutes.  This shows that the majority of users use the Citi Bikes for short trips, not full commutes.

##### Checkout Times by Gender

The male and female genders have very similar patterns, with a sharp peak at 5 minutes for men and 6 minutes for women.  The unknown gender observes a slightly different pattern, with an elongated peak of similar numbers of rides for trip durations of 8 through 25 minutes.

##### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

The frequency of morning trips is relatively consistent for Monday through Fridays between 7 and 9am.  The frequency of evening trips between 5 and 7pm is consistent on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. There is a notable drop in the frequency of evening trips on Wednesdays, and the peak time for evening trips on Fridays is slightly earlier.
